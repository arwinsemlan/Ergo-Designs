# Ergo-Designs
A keyboard designer

## This is a keyboard designer that lets you make any keyboard you would like
Ergo-Designs helps you make any keyboard in an easy and intuitive way with basic GUI elements.

This is my first ever C program, so it took quite a long time, but I think it is worth it. This project has been an opportunity for me to learn C.
I have used SDL2 to render to the screen. 

## Controls
Left mouse - if close to a line's end, grabs it and moves it 

Right mouse - adds a new line from the starting position

Middle mouse - moves around the camera

d - deletes the line you have grabbed

## Updates will come
This is only the first version of this program. It will become better and have more features. I already have many ideas on how to improve the program.

## How to run
Copy this repo 

Then run the makefile


This should be everything. You may have to download SDL2 in another way or add the keyboard-save.kbdcat, but I don't think it is necessary.
