# Ergo-Designs
A keyboard designer

## This is a keyboard designer that lets you make any keyboard you would like
Ergo-Designs helps you make any keyboard in an easy and intuitive way. With the basic GUI elements.

This is my first ever C program so it took quite a long time but i think it is worth it. This project has been an oppertunity for me to learn C.
I have used SDL2 to render to the screen. 

## Controls
Left mouse - if close to a lines end grabs it and moves it 
Rigth mouse - adds new line from starting positon
Middle mouse - moves around the camera
d - deletes the line you have grabed

## Updates will come
This is only the first version of this program it will become better and have more features. I already have many ides how to improve the program.

**How to run**
Copy this repo 
Then run the make file

This should be everything you may have to download SDL2 in another way or add the keyboard-save.kbdcat but i dont think it is neccesary
